# Rust Notebook

The structure of this notebook will go as follows:

- Headings will denote the project that is worked on
- After that there will be subheadings denoting each different part of the leaning process, such as how things work
- Block quotes will be used for my personal notes on the matter

## Making files in rust to compile

Run `cargo new <name of project>`

Then a directory with that project name will be made and the main project file will be located under src
> May only compile because of the cargo being the compiler and the cargo compiler needing specific parameters to run
